Jake DeBrusk is an interesting player here because Ryan says there has been “rumblings among the fanbase of discontent with DeBrusk, to put it mildly.” He says he “wouldn’t be shocked” if he was traded by the trade deadline. For now, he’s on my list, but keep an eye out for that.

Craig Smith is the next forward on the list. Ryan says “he’s been fine, not great.” But he’s a solid middle-six player, and it would be hard to lose that for nothing.

For the last player, there are a few options. Both Ondrej Kase and Nick Ritchie will be RFAs. Anders Bjork is a young player who has 2 more years left at a low salary. The fourth option is Trent Frederic. Ryan admits that it may be recency bias, but he think
Frederic makes the most sense out of all of them.
